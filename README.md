# i2c-uno-adafruit-PlayExpress

This example code shows How connect two Device using I2C bus interface.  This will be very useful when your project need multiple device and control/communicate each other.  For example Adafruit Circuit Playgorund Express comes with several sensors and RGB LED's etc, we can read/write from other device.

# Hardware used 
    a. Arduino UNO 
    b. Adafruit Circuit Playgorund Express 
    c. Button Switch and connecting wires 

Integrating Arduino UNO and Adafruit Circuit Playground Express board using I2C communication. Here Uno as master device and playground as slave. Master can send a commands to slave device using I2C bus. Slave Device will receive 
comands. This example code simply On OFF RED LED on the board.

# Wiring
